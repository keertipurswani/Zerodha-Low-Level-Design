# ZerodhaLowLevelDesign
I teach on YouTube and I wrote this code Live on my channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVkxdFJLgwE&t=659s
I have added comments for those who haven't watched the video but you would have much better understanding if you went through the video.

It is working Code but it is just for demo purposes.
We call it Zerodha low level design but it's obviously low level design of any stock broker app (like upstox)
Focus is to write code following SOLID principles, and apply design patterns where needed.

This is first video in the series and we will be writing uber low level code in the next live.
